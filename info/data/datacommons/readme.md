# Dive Into Data Commons

Join us in creating new UX tools and industry maps for Sustainable Material Management (SMM) that integrate with [Google Data Commons](https://datacommons.org).

We'll be using the Google Data Commons API to pull international data for our industry impact timelines. Please add to the notes to include how to view data from the API using Postman, JQuery and React, and save international Environment country data as .csv files using Python.


Get started with our [Data Commons Lite setup steps](/localsite/info/data/datacommons/#setup) 

We'll also be pushing US EPA industry impact data into Google Data Commons.
